# Find your Hat! - The Terminal Game
A simple terminal game created with Node.js  
## Introduction - the project's aim
This is challange from a javascript course at Codecademy.com to test knowledge of intermediate javascript concepts, git, and gitHub. 

I was provided with modules that could accept user input, and the conditions of how the game would be played. The rest of the game mechanics and logic is my work and it is included in the files: main.js, field.js and player.js.

To challange myself even further i implemented an own algorithm that ensures that each generated map is always solveable. 

## How to play:
Use WASD + ENTER to control the character and navigate the field in search of your hat. e.g. W + ENTER in the terminal makes you go up. If you find the hat, you win!

## Technologies:
- Javascript ES6
- Node.js v14.15.3.
- NPM V14.15.3
- Visual Studio Code 1.52.1

## Launch
To run the project you need run main.js in a terminal with Node and NPM installed. Any computer is able to run it.
