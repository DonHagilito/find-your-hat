## Introduction - the project's aim
This is challange from a javascript course at Codecademy.com to test knowledge of intermediate javascript concepts, git, and gitHub. 

I was provided with modules that could accept user input, and the conditions of how the game would be played. The rest of the game mechanics and logic is my work and it is included in the files: main.js, field.js and player.js.

## How to play:
Use WASD to control the character and navigate the field in search of your hat. If you find it, you win!
